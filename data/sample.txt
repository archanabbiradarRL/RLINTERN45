The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Time heals all wounds.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Practice makes perfect.
Knowledge is power.
Fortune favors the bold.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The early bird catches the worm.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
All roads lead to Rome.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Happiness depends upon ourselves.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
Turn your wounds into wisdom.
Dream big and dare to fail.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.
If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else.
Courage is grace under pressure.
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Opportunities don't happen. You create them.
Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.
Difficulties in life don’t come to destroy you, but to help you realize your hidden potential.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
A goal without a plan is just a wish.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
